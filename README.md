A web version of the Simon memory game. Built with HTML5, CSS and vanilla JavaScript. Inspired by the project proposal of <a href="https://learn.freecodecamp.org/coding-interview-prep/take-home-projects/build-a-simon-game/">FreeCodeCamp</a>. Currently only tested in Chrome, Android Chrome, Edge and Firefox.

Play back the sound sequence in the correct order. The game offers to play modes: regular and strict. In regular mode, if the user errs the game repeats the sequence and the game continues. In strict mode, the game resets to a new sequence. In both cases, the user wins when all 20 tones are played in the correct order.
